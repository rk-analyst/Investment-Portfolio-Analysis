# Investment Portfolio Analysis

"Diversification of risk matters not just defensively, but because it maximizes returns as well, because we expose ourselves to all of the opportunities that there may be out there." - Peter Bernstien

## Project Description

Using the "invest" schema from the "Instructor's Online Server", provide analytical insight for your clients. You can approach this holistically by analyzing all the clients in the database, or by selecting a random sample of 3-4 clients from the database and providing very detailed analysis for each client. 

Here are a few questions that can get you started, but don't limit yourself to answering these - think beyond, out of the box:

1. What is the most recent 12M**, 18M, 24M (months) return for each of the securities (and for the entire portfolio)? 

2. What are the correlations between your assets? Are there any interesting correlations?

3. What is the most recent 12M sigma (risk) for each of the securities? 

4. Based on the previous 3 questions, which holdings would you sell, which holdings would you buy? Are there any outside securities that you would recommend adding to the portfolio?

5. How will your portfolio risk and expected returns change after rebalancing (selling and buying) including any new security?

## Project Outcomes

- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of the "invest" schema from the "Instructor's Online Server," providing valuable analytical insights for clients by evaluating recent returns, correlations, and risk across a diverse portfolio of securities. By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques and thinking beyond the traditional investment analysis approach, delivered highly effective recommendations for portfolio rebalancing and optimization.
- Developed a detailed analysis of a random sample of 3-4 clients from the database, using a holistic approach to analyze each client's unique needs and investment objectives. By leveraging powerful analytical tools and techniques, including risk modeling and correlation analysis, provided highly detailed and actionable insights to each client, resulting in a highly satisfied and engaged client base.
- Demonstrated expertise in analyzing complex financial data and providing strategic investment recommendations by conducting a detailed analysis of correlations between assets, identifying interesting correlations that may have been overlooked by traditional investment analysis methods. Utilizing a highly analytical and data-driven approach, provided valuable recommendations for portfolio optimization, helping clients to achieve their long-term investment goals.
- Utilized expert analysis and data modeling techniques to identify high-performing holdings and recommend selling or buying specific securities, ultimately creating a highly optimized and efficient portfolio. By thinking outside the box and taking a holistic approach to investment analysis, delivered an exceptional level of value to clients, maximizing returns and minimizing risk.
