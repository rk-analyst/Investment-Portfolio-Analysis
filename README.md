# Investment Portfolio Analysis

"Diversification of risk matters not just defensively, but because it maximizes returns as well, because we expose ourselves to all of the opportunities that there may be out there." - Peter Bernstien

## Project Description

Using the "invest" schema from the "Instructor's Online Server", provide analytical insight for your clients. You can approach this holistically by analyzing all the clients in the database, or by selecting a random sample of 3-4 clients from the database and providing very detailed analysis for each client. 

Here are a few questions that can get you started, but don't limit yourself to answering these - think beyond, out of the box:

1. What is the most recent 12M**, 18M, 24M (months) return for each of the securities (and for the entire portfolio)? 

2. What are the correlations between your assets? Are there any interesting correlations?

3. What is the most recent 12M sigma (risk) for each of the securities? 

4. Based on the previous 3 questions, which holdings would you sell, which holdings would you buy? Are there any outside securities that you would recommend adding to the portfolio?

5. How will your portfolio risk and expected returns change after rebalancing (selling and buying) including any new security?
